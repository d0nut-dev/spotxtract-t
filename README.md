# spotxtract-t

### Description:
Creates folders and downloads all your spotify playlists trough [spotify-downloader](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader).

App/Script constists of two separate parts:
1. spotxtract-t/spotdl0.py - downloads all your playlists without an order. (optionally checks for missing ones);
2. spotxtract-t/gen-folders/index.js - takes the JSON previously generated by [spotify-folders](https://github.com/mikez/spotify-folders), generates a folders with the structure provided by your JSON, and creates 'hierarchy-mod.json' file that contains the appended playlists names;

_Before using make sure to install spotdl and setup your spotify credentials in './spotdl0.py' and './gen_folder/spotify-module.js'._ 

_If you want to extract your folders - install and extract JSON of their structure trough [spotify_folders](https://github.com/mikez/spotify-folders) and then put it into or instead of the file 'gen-folders/hierarchy.json'._



### Current tasks:
- Add a feature of linking files from their original places to the folders generated by 'gen-folders'.
- Rewrite spotdl0.py to download songs to one main folder instead of multiple playlists folders.



*_Python and NodeJS are required to run spotdl0 and gen-folders respectively._
